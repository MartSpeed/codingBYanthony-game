Hello, my name is John Anthony. I am a M.E.R.N. stack developer. I like to read books, both fiction and non-fiction. I like to play video games. I like to talk about finances. I like to talk about code. So I make code and make projects until the information kicks in.

<p>
The first game in that I will be working on this year. I am going to use vanilla javascript. I want to use this to strengthen my javascript skills as well as learn to make games along the way. I am going to record myself on my steps here. I will only be working on this project Friday's after work to 2300 hours on Sunday. I will record my work and my progress along the way to reinforce my understanding.
