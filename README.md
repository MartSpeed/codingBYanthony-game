<p>This is a rough draft: last updated April 7, 2023</p>

<p>
Hello, my name is John Anthony. I am a M.E.R.N. stack developer. I like to read books, both fiction and non-fiction. I like to play video games. I like to talk about finances. I like to talk about code. So I make code and make projects until the information kicks in.
</p>

<p>
The first game in that I will be working on this year. I am going to use vanilla javascript. I want to use this to strengthen my javascript skills as well as learn to make games along the way. I am going to record myself on my steps here. I will only be working on this project Friday's after work to 2300 hours on Sunday. I will record my work and my progress along the way to reinforce my understanding.
</p>

<p>
I am going to build this using vanilla js first and then I am going to convert it into a Next.js application to be hosted on the website as well.
</p>

### GOAL

<p>
Th goal of this game design project in javascript is to stay consistent and keep building until I start building my own things. Using my own ideas and methods to start stumbling around in the code to make something that I want or to clone something that I have seen before.
